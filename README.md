# React ML Model Integration with Django

This project demonstrates how to integrate a React frontend with an ML model using Django as the backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Set up Django backend:**
   Follow the instructions in the Django project to set up the backend server.

5. **Integrate with ML model:**
   Update the frontend components to send requests to the Django backend and handle responses from the ML model.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the React components and application logic.
- **`public/`**: Contains the public assets and HTML template.
- **`django-backend/`**: Contains the Django backend for the project.

## Dependencies

**Credit Card Fraud Detection Model Readme**

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning model developed for the purpose of detecting credit card fraud. The model utilizes the Python libraries Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.17% of transactions being fraudulent. Due to confidentiality reasons, the original features of the dataset are transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), resulting in 28 principal components.

## Installation
To use this model, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas


This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, these metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's effectiveness in detecting fraud while minimizing false positives.

## Model Deployment
Once trained and evaluated, the model can be deployed in a production environment to detect credit card fraud in real-time transactions. Integration with a backend system can facilitate automated fraud detection and prevention.

## Future Improvements
- Explore advanced anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forests or Local Outlier Factor to improve model performance.
- Implement oversampling techniques such as SMOTE to address class imbalance and enhance model robustness.
- Continuously monitor model performance and update it with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
